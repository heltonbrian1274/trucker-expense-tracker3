These checks highlight opportunities to improve the accessibility of your web app. Automatic detection can only detect a subset of issues and does not guarantee the accessibility of your web app, so manual testing is also encouraged.
Contrast

Low-contrast text is difficult or impossible for many users to read. Learn how to provide sufficient color contrast.
Failing Elements
